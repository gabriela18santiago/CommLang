# CommLang
COMMLANG is a language that simplifies the communication from client-to-server from your own device. This language provides a series of commands that are simple to follow to create servers and clients, send messages and receive an update of new activities in the server. We used PLY libraries for the parsing (YACC) and lexing (LEX) operations in the language reader.

Usage:
-	Run CommLang.py in terminal (python3 CommLang.py) or in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, PyCharm,etc)
-	Run the listed commands below

The commands are:
-	create_server  Create a server
-	create_client  Create a client
-	connect  Set connection to desired device, device name and parameters needed.
-	send_message  Create and send messages to the other end of the client, string line needed.
-	receive_update  Receive feedback from server.
-	close  Closes the connection with client.
